# GitHub Enterprise Cloud

[GitHub Enterprise](https://repo.roche.com) is a software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features.

### Why use GitHub?

1.Setting up secure workflows  
2.Understanding the GitHub Flow  
3.Reviewing and discussing work  
4.Planning and tracking work  
5.Automating with GitHub Actions  
6.Integrating apps with GitHub  
7.Using the GitHub API  


### How to get Read Access

People subscribed to the group GLOAZUGHAdmin_ReadOnly will now be linked to organization Roche-SDS-Github-KT, as they are already in an organization they will see our internal repositories. (This organization will be removed once innersourcing solutions by Microsoft is provided).

This makes more sense as we will just have people from platform or usual collaborators in the organization.

Remember to remove all non-platform people from the ldap groups you are managing.
