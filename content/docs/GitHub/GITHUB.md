### How to get Read Access

Reader access to GitHub can be provided to your team by subscribing to the group [GLOAZUGHAdmin_ReadOnly](https://gds-selfsubscription.roche.com/#/group/GLOAZUGHAdmin_ReadOnly).  
  
**Note** : This group will be only used for Reader access and no other purpose, once innersource is enabled we will plug out this group and everyone would have the same access as this group by default.
  
**Usage**: Once added you will have access to read internal respositories only of any organization in the enterprise
  


Remember to remove all non-platform people from the ldap groups you are managing.
