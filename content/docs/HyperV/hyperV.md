# **Hyper-V**

Hyper-V cluster is a set of several similar Hyper-V servers (called nodes), which can be specifically configured to work together, so that one node can take the load (VMs, services, processes) if another one goes down or if there is a disaster. Customers can request for virtual machines to consume in CI/CD pipelines. We provide a dedicated cluster to manage virtual machines by the team or we manage virtual machines in a shared cluster for the team.
