# **Hyper-V**

Hyper-V is virtualization software that, well, virtualizes software. It can not only virtualize operating systems but also entire hardware components, such as hard drives and network switches. Unlike Fusion and Virtualbox, Hyper-V is not limited to the user&#39;s device. You can use it for server virtualization, too. Hyper-V is available in three versions.

- Hyper-V for Windows Servers
- Hyper-V Servers
- Hyper-V on Windows 10

Hyper-V for Windows Servers is an add-on to the Windows Server OS.

Numerous advantages associated with hardware virtualization technology are:
<ol>
<ul>Manage virtual and dedicated server instances, just like Hyper-V for Windows Servers</ul> 
<ul>Managing and controlling virtual machines is easier than managing and controlling a physical server.</ul>
<ul> Virtualizing resources allows administrators to pool their physical resources</ul>
<ul>With virtualization technology, administrators don&#39;t have to wait for every application to be certified on new hardware. They can simply set up the environment and migrate the virtual machine, and everything works exactly as before</ul>

</ol>
