# **Innersource within Roche**

## **What is Open Source?**

<p align="justify">Open source projects are accessible to everyone. Anyone can use these open source softwares. They can also view, modify, and distribute a project for any purpose—as enforced by open source licenses. Similarly, anyone can help build open source software. In general, projects are developed by a community of distributed contributors who share code, feedback, bug reports, and more.</p>

## **What is innersource?**

**An open source community behind our firewall**

Innersource is a development methodology where engineers build proprietary software using best practices from large-scale open source projects, like Kubernetes or Microsoft's Visual Studio Code.

## **What can we bring from opensource into innersource?**

- **Open collaboration encourages more contributions**

    <p align="justify">More contributions mean more opportunities. Open source projects can accept changes from anybody in the world. That's a lot of brainpower dedicated to advancing a project, meeting user needs, and finding and fixing bugs.

    Similarly, innersource brings more ideas to the table. Teams can more easily innovate—and with more people inspecting code for errors and inconsistencies, they can build securer, more reliable software. Problems are found and fixed before the wrong person discovers them.</p>

- **Developers don't always have to start from scratch**

    <p align="justify">Anyone can discover and reuse open source projects for nearly any reason. People can even use them to build other things or modify them to suit their specific needs.

    Similarly, innersource code helps your team discover, customize, and reuse existing internal projects. They can also establish and build on a shared set of documented processes to optimize the way your company deploys and uses software. This can lead to lower cost, greater flexibility, and an end to vendor lock-in.</p>

- **Transparent decision-making builds process, trust, and alignment**

    <p align="justify">Successful open source maintainers document their decisions by default. Because each conversation has its own URL and a history of comments for context, time zones matter less, and developers can work asynchronously without skipping a beat.

    Opening up your projects brings a new level of transparency to your organization. Not only is the code visible but also the process and decision-making behind it. Well-documented conversations help developers on distributed teams get up to speed and start building. And with work happening in the open, collaboration can also include product managers, designers, security teams, and more.</p>

- **Participation is critical**

    <p align="justify">The success of any open source project depends on participation. There are many built-in reasons to contribute—to improve skills, find a mentor, or build a reputation, for example—but project maintainers also need to create a community culture that welcomes and encourages participation.

    Within an enterprise, individual developers can pursue their interests, share ideas on a level playing field, and more easily learn from their peers. However, innersource also requires a cultural shift. Your team's culture will need to encourage knowledge sharing and welcome contributions from across your organization.</p>

- **Core development teams strengthen a project&#39;s process**

<<<<<<< HEAD
    Open source projects may have thousands of contributors and community members, but a much smaller team is usually responsible for the project's overall direction. This speeds up decision-making and ensures that someone's always responsible.

    For innersource projects, distributing control across a smaller group of participants frequently makes approvals and reviews more effective. Creating a small, cross-functional team of decision makers can also help teams stick to quality standards and gain executive support.</p>

## **InnerSource Best Practices:**

• Realistic vision, articulated shared purpose, and clearly defined problems or opportunities being addressed

• Key participants (initiators, catalysts, evangelists) should have collaborative experience/mindset

• Socialization model to help new participants acclimate

• Programmatically facilitated continuous interaction and behavioral consistency

• Start with an intra-organizational group of people with defined shared goals

## **The anatomy of an innersource project**

A typical innersource project will have the following Teams.

- **Maintainers** : Contributors who are responsible for driving the vision and managing the organizational aspects of the project. They are not necessarily the original owners or authors of the code.
- **Contributors** : Everyone who has contributed something back to the project.
- **Community members** : People who use the project. They might be active in conversations or express their opinion on the project's direction.

## **Tools of the trade**

Here are a few tools that drive open source development on GitHub. They'll also be key components of any innersource project.

- **Issues** : Issues are where developers bring up topics and start conversations. If someone finds a bug or has an idea for a new feature, an issue is a great place to start—and anyone with access to it can join in on the discussion.
- **Pull requests** : Pull requests are living conversations about changes that developers would like to make to a project. They're where people start working on solutions and review changes that are in progress.
- **Synchronous chat channels** : Sometimes teams need to make quick decisions. Synchronous chat channels like Slack are complementary to discussions and comments on GitHub and great for talking through problems in real time.

## **How are we planning to bring innersource within Roche?**

<p align="justify">We plan to have a separate organization( [Roche-Innersource](https://github.com/Roche-Innersource) ) for all innersource projects. Each and every team member or contributor can view all the repositories in the organization and if they decide to commit to any of these projects you can add yourself to the group stated below and get started right away.</p>

## **How to access the Organization?**

The organization will be open to everyone, but if you want to get added to a team into the organization you can visit and subscribe to this group [here](https://gds-selfsubscription.roche.com/#/group/GLOAZUGHAdmin_Innersource).
