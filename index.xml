DSC provides a set of Power Shell language extensions and cmdlets. The main idea is to provide a method for maintaining consistent configuration across computers or devices.Using central DSC server, projects can store OS configuration and use it several times across builds.Mainly used for configuration, deployment and management of systems and configuration.
Woodpeckers team is supplying a complete solution for the business partners who would like to enhance their DSC practice.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://woodpeckers-wiki.roche.com/docs/dsc/readme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://woodpeckers-wiki.roche.com/docs/dsc/readme/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://woodpeckers-wiki.roche.com/docs/ear/ear/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://woodpeckers-wiki.roche.com/docs/ear/ear/</guid><description>Enterprise Architect # Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect is a visual modeling and design tool based on the OMG UML.

We provide a dedicated cluster to manage virtual machines by the team or we manage virtual machines in a shared cluster for the team.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://woodpeckers-wiki.roche.com/docs/hyperv/readme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://woodpeckers-wiki.roche.com/docs/hyperv/readme/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://woodpeckers-wiki.roche.com/docs/innersource/innersource/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://woodpeckers-wiki.roche.com/docs/innersource/innersource/</guid><description>Innersource within Roche # What is Open Source? # Open source projects are accessible to everyone. Anyone can use these open source softwares. They can also view, modify, and distribute a project for any purposeâ€”as enforced by open source licenses. Similarly, anyone can help build open source software. In general, projects are developed by a community of distributed contributors who share code, feedback, bug reports, and more.

This means everyone can be certain that what goes to production is exactly what was built and tested. Third-party packages (such as NuGet, npm, PowerShell, and Chocolatey) and Docker containers are also supported, allowing you to enforce quality standards, monitor for open-source licenses, and scan for vulnerabilities across all packages, much earlier in the development cycle.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://woodpeckers-wiki.roche.com/docs/proget/readme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://woodpeckers-wiki.roche.com/docs/proget/readme/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://woodpeckers-wiki.roche.com/docs/sonarqube/readme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://woodpeckers-wiki.roche.com/docs/sonarqube/readme/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://woodpeckers-wiki.roche.com/docs/sonarqube/sonarqube/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://woodpeckers-wiki.roche.com/docs/sonarqube/sonarqube/</guid><description>Sonarqube # SonarQube provides automated capabilities for continuous inspection of code, detect bugs, code smells and security vulnerabilities on 20+ programming languages, with the historical data and many features it gives enormous possibilities for the project to improve their code.
